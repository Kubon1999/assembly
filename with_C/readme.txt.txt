Implement function in 32-bit assembly wieth the following prototype


int * merge(int tab1[], int tab2[], int n);

Function should merge two arrays taht are the same length and give in result a pointer to a differend table that is stored in .data block. You should chceck in assembly if the n is <= 4
because the new array should have memeroy for 8 elements, (2 tables of 4 elements)
